Group Member Names: Harry & Lili

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):  
-- To be collaborative and enjoy the struggle, and learn more JavaScript! We would like to get more comfortable writing more concise code. Expressive commits.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:  
-- Lili can hold Harry more accountable for more frequent commits and communication.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):  
-- Complete a bulk of the paired work after class.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):  
-- Daily checkins on project status. We will define a time as we get moving.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):  
-- Writing better formatted code (grammar, semantics, etc.).

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):  
--We expect to take turns working on layout vs functionality

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):  
-- Discuss features we want to implement before coding them in.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:  
-- Communicate frequently and openly. Be honest but considerate.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):  
-- Look into Trello, and Github for collaboration.
